# User Management Dashboard

## Purpose

This is a **User Management Dashboard** where:

- A list of users with details such as Name, Email, Company, Phone, and Website are listed
  - The request to jsonplaceholder is made and then all the users are stored locally through localStorage - the task is small, otherwise other state management tools can be used such as Redux.
  - The emails are displayed as clickable links that open the user's default email client when clicked (using `mailto:`).
  - The phones are formatted as prefix, 9 digits and extension - this can be modified for special needs and also third party libraries can be used
  - The urls are listed as they are coming from jsonplaceholder - if they are stored properly the link is opening the page. 

- Edit existing users
  -All the fields has rules - the required fields are marked and if we try to save we will receive ui message that they are required
  -The url has rule for validation - if we try to type not url we will receive message
  -The email has rule for validation 
  -The prefix can be changed - only 359 and 48 are added and the prefix of the edited phone number

- Delete users from the list.
  - Popconfirm window appears - if we confirm delete locally the user from the list

- Create new users
  -Add new user with the same modal we are using for edit 
  -All the rules are applicable

-Notification
  -There are notification for creating and editing user as a popup window
